#Eloise Cresswell

Hi there ðŸ‘‹ , I'm Eloise and I have just completed a immersive 16 week bootcamp with the School of Code. During this bootcamp, I have really enjoyed learning about all things Front-End and AI and am hoping to continue to build and develop those skills. 

I currently live in Birmingham, UK and am actively seeking employment.
