# Eloise Cresswell

Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Eloise and I have just completed an immersive 16-week bootcamp with the School of Code. During this bootcamp, I have really enjoyed learning about all things Front-End and AI and am hoping to continue to build and develop those skills.

I currently live in Birmingham, UK, and am actively seeking employment.
