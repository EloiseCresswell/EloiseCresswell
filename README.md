My Portfolio - eloisecresswell.studio
This is my initial attempt at a portfolio... aims are

1. Create a pipeline that (as a minimum) facilitates Continuous Delivery (CD) from the main branch of your repo, connected to your and have a placeholder page deployed with a first commit
   2)Plan and wireframe an initial prototype for your portfolio, ready to get some quick feedback from others

To do Step 1:
🚀Choose a Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) Tool: GitHub Actions (for now) ✅

🚀Create a Basic Web Page:
Create a simple HTML file (e.g., index.html) with a placeholder message like "Welcome to Eloise Cresswell Studio!". ✅
Add and commit this file to your GitHub repository ✅

🚀Set up GitHub Actions:
Create a .github/workflows directory in your GitHub repository. ✅
Inside this directory, create a YAML file (e.g., deploy.yml) to define your CI/CD workflow. ✅
Configure the workflow to trigger on every push to the main branch. ✅
Define the steps needed to build and deploy your website. Since it's a static site, you might only need to copy files to a server. ✅

🚀Configure Deployment:
Decide where you want to deploy your site using GitHub Pages
Set up my hosting provider to serve my website. This might involve configuring DNS settings for my domain.

🚀Connect Domain Name:
Configure my DNS settings to point my domain (eloisecresswell.studio) to the hosting provider where my site is deployed.
(May need to set up DNS records (like A records or CNAME records) provided by your hosting provider.

🚀Test Deployment:
Push a commit to the main branch of your repository to trigger the CI/CD pipeline.
Verify that your website is deployed correctly and accessible at your domain (eloisecresswell.studio).
Customize Placeholder Page:

Once deployed, then I can customize the placeholder page with desired content, design, and branding. (Step 2 is a basic wireframe of this)
