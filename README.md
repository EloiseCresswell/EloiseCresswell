My Portfolio - eloisecresswell.studio
This is my initial attempt at a portfolio... aims are
1) Create a pipeline that (as a minimum) facilitates Continuous Delivery (CD) from the main branch of your repo, connected to your and have a placeholder page deployed with a first commit
2)Plan and wireframe an initial prototype for your portfolio, ready to get some quick feedback from others

To do Step 1:
ðŸš€Choose a Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) Tool: GitHub Actions (for now) 

ðŸš€Create a Basic Web Page:
Create a simple HTML file (e.g., index.html) with a placeholder message like "Welcome to Eloise Cresswell Studio!".
Add and commit this file to your GitHub repository.
Set up GitHub Actions:

ðŸš€Create a .github/workflows directory in your GitHub repository.
Inside this directory, create a YAML file (e.g., deploy.yml) to define your CI/CD workflow.
CoðŸš€nfigure the workflow to trigger on every push to the main branch.
Define the steps needed to build and deploy your website. Since it's a static site, you might only need to copy files to a server.
Configure Deployment:

ðŸš€ Decide where you want to deploy your site. Since I have a domain name (eloisecresswell.studio), I'll need to host it somewhere.
Choose a hosting provider. Options include GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, AWS S3, or others.
Set up your hosting provider to serve my website. This might involve configuring DNS settings for my domain.

ðŸš€Connect Domain Name:
Configure my DNS settings to point my domain (eloisecresswell.studio) to the hosting provider where my site is deployed.
(May need to set up DNS records (like A records or CNAME records) provided by your hosting provider.


ðŸš€Test Deployment:
Push a commit to the main branch of your repository to trigger the CI/CD pipeline.
Verify that your website is deployed correctly and accessible at your domain (eloisecresswell.studio).
Customize Placeholder Page:

Once deployed, then I can customize the placeholder page with desired content, design, and branding. (Step 2 is a basic wireframe of this)
